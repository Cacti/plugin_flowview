----[ Purpose

	This plugin allows you to see reports based off the data in your Netflow flows.

----[ Features

	Fully customizable reports

----[ Installation

	Required:

	First, make sure you have the plugin architecture installed.

	Then, Install just like any other plugin, just copy it into the plugin directory,
	and Use Console->Plugin Mangement to Install and Enable.

	Then, you must install flow-tools.  Generally, flow-tools is available through yum, 
	apt-get, emerge, etc.  Locate the path for your flow-tools (typically /usr/bin), and
	decide on a location for your flow data (in many cases /var/flow, or any other location).

	Once you have done all of this, goto Console->Settings->Misc and setup this information
	in the FlowView section.

	Next you have to setup your Cacti server as a FlowView sink from your various
	sources.  Then, from FlowView -> Listeners, you must add the various listeners for all
	your flow-capture sources.

	Optional:

	If you don't already have flows coming to the cacti box and being stored with flow-capture
	you may follow the steps below to have cacti do this.

	Next copy the 'flow-caputure' file in the flowview plugin directory to '/etc/init.d/'
	or the appropriate location.  You have to edit this file to set the cacti base path.
	This file also supercedes whatever the operating system installed.

	Finally, start the 'flow-capture' process using '/etc/init.d/flow-capture start'.

	You may also want to insure that 'flow-capture' is a startup service using your operating
	systems default process.

	Also, remember that when using the Cacti 'flow-capture' init binary, that when you make
	changes to the various listeners, you must subsequently 'restart' the 'flow-capture' binary.
